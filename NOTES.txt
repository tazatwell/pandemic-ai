Developer Notes:


Updated 4.10 - Had to git reset bc I accidentally rm'd my notes file. Now deletes cards correctly after cure.
	Working on allowing cures to remove ALL disease cubes off of a boad.

Updated 4.2 - Now on 7.6
	Now performs outbreaks correctly, and quits game immediately after 8th outbreak.
	Working on coding the outbreaks, currently debugging ONE QUIET NIGHT card.


0. added my id_rsa key to automate credential authentication
	0.1	Using credential storer to store keys
1. Create the board game Pandemic
	1.1 Store the map as a graph, w vertices and edges.
	1.2 Store the player deck and infection deck using an array.
	1.3 Each city will also have a counter for the number of disease cubes in that city.
2. Use TravisCI for automated unit testing.
3. Store number of players ( 1 - 7).
4. Store all character roles.
5. Randomly assign each character a player role.
6. Create a player class - should have role, position, and list of cards
	6.1 Create a card class - should have isEvent bool member and name.
7. Loop - while game is not over, do:
	7.1 Display options - print all cities w diseases, player info, for every nearby city print an option w coresponding number.
	7.3 Draw two cards from infection deck. infect cities
	7.4 At end of every players' turn, draw 2 cards. allow fast travel to any city w card, but then delete card after.
		7.41 Give each player cards at the beginning of the game
		7.42 If player has more than 7 cards, they need to discard at the end of their turn.
		7.43	Code building research stations
		7.431 Delete player card if he/she wants to build a research station
		7.44 Allow option to travel between cities with research stations
	7.5	Code epidemic cards - have an epidemic counter and 'free Epidemic' tracker.
		7.51 Epidemic cards involve splitting the deck in a certain way - make this a fn so later in the game you can abstract this.
		7.52 Eventually abstract this by asking for player input.
	7.7 Code outbreaks and outbreak tracker
	7.6	Code event cards
	7.7 Code cures to diseases - need 5 of same color and be in research station
	7.8 Rt now I have a victory condition if all disease cubes on the board are taken off. This needs to be removed.
	7.9 Add discard pile for player cards
	7.10 Add support for colored disease cubes, decrement properly, and if no. of disease cubes for any color is 0, players lose.
9. Only discard cards at the end of the player's turn, i.e. if player receives a card and now has 8, he/she doesn't discard until the end of his/her turn
10. Implement trading cards
	10.1 Event cards dont take an action
11/0. Implement player abilities
	11/0.1 To test this, ask player which role he/she wants to be.
11. Code difficulties - easy is 4, medium is 5, brave is 6
12. There should be a global limit on how many disease cubes are on the board?
	12.1 If city already has research station, you can't build one
13. Add code style guidelines on comments, spacing, no. of chars per line, trailing white spaces. Refactor.
	13.1 Make no. of disease cubes on city a global const.
14. Make a public release, and make this repo public.
15. Build an AI to solve this game.
16. Test the performance of different AI constructed using different models
	16.1 Data Analysis w R?
	16.2 See which models perform better w/ 4 epidemic cards, 5, 6, 7, 8, ... and see what the stopping point is (even AI can't win)
	16.3 See which models require the least no. of games to win
	16.4 Try changing the no. of moves / turn, see how data differs.
	16.5 Create a new graph algorithms based on custom-created node weight and finding most efficent path that Medic should take to cure most disease
		cubes.
		16.51 A direct flight is like a connection from dest. city to every other city. There are edges between all cities that have a research station
			(like a dense graph).
		16.52 Need to create a value for weight of nodes: based on no. of disease cubes on city, no. of nieghbors, and no. of disease cubes on neighbors
